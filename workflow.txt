add the new list of "selected" items to the center panel
currently thinking of making a mini panel to hold the product list indiviudal items that have all its info on it,
so you click an item on the product selector and it pops up in the center panel
(is there all along but set visible = true on click/add to cart)
with all of its info with a quantity field aswell for ease of use, maybe a remove button.



add inner join functionality to orders page (Search for order with customer name)

adding item to cart not working yet******************



Then copy all the products in the cart into a new order
 mainview is just gonna have a table showing the cart items and some other feature that i could think of
